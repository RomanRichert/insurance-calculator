= Project Overview

== Technology Stack

=== Backend

- Quarkus 3 (Jakarta EE, RESTEasy Reactive)
- Kotlin
- Hibernate ORM + Panache
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway (database migration)
- CSV import via Apache Commons CSV
- OpenAPI (Swagger UI)
- CORS and Exception Handling support
- SSL via self-signed keystore

=== Frontend

- Nuxt 3
- Vue 3
- PrimeVue
- TypeScript + Pinia for state management

== Features

* Premium calculation via input form or API
* Historical log of all requests with full data
* Dynamic CSV import for postcode mapping
* Factor configuration via application config
* Global error handling and JSON error structure
* Request logging with interceptor
* Full HTTPS support with keystore (self-signed)
* Manual keystore renewal script:

[source,bash]
----
cd ../../../../../
chmod +x ./update-keystore.sh
./update-keystore.sh
----

* Full-stack startup with `docker-compose` via

[source,bash]
----
cd ../../../../../
chmod +x ./build-and-run.sh
./build-and-run.sh
----

* Database migrations via Flyway
* Modular and extensible architecture

== Premium Formula

The premium is calculated using:

[source]
----
premium = mileageFactor * vehicleFactor * regionFactor
----

Each component is resolved based on user input and imported configuration data.

== Architecture

[plantuml,format=svg]
----
@startuml
actor User
participant "Frontend (Nuxt)" as FE
participant "Backend (Quarkus)" as BE
database "PostgreSQL" as DB

User -> FE : enters input
FE -> BE : POST /insurance-request
BE -> DB : persist request
BE -> DB : lookup factors
BE --> FE : return calculated premium

User -> FE : views history
FE -> BE : GET /insurance-request
BE -> DB : fetch all
BE --> FE : return list

== Default Ports and Access

When running the application with the default configuration:

[cols="2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Service | URL / Host

| Frontend (Nuxt)
| http://localhost:3000

| Backend (HTTP)
| http://localhost:8080

| Backend (HTTPS)
| https://localhost:8443

| PostgreSQL (in container)
| db:5432

| PostgreSQL (host access)
| localhost:15432
|===

== Monitoring and Observability

The system provides built-in observability via Prometheus and Grafana.

=== Monitoring Tools

[cols="2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Tool | Access

| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090
| Grafana | http://localhost:3001
| Swagger UI | https://localhost:8443/q/swagger
| OpenAPI | https://localhost:8443/q/openapi
| Metrics | https://localhost:8443/q/metrics
|===

Prometheus scrapes metrics from the Quarkus backend (/q/metrics) and visualizes them via Grafana.

    All observability endpoints are exposed by the backend and available only via HTTPS by default.

== Development Notes

* CORS support is enabled via a JAX-RS response filter (`CorsFilter.kt`)
* CSV files for postcode data are placed in `src/main/resources/data`
* All user-facing errors follow a uniform structure (`ErrorResponse`)
* Vehicle and region factors are injected via config mapping
* SSL enabled by default; replace `keystore.p12` manually if needed
